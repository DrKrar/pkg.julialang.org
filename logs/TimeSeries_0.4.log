field extraction methods work
  > timestamp, values, colnames and meta
4 facts verified.
type constructors enforce invariants
  > unequal length between values and timestamp fails
  > unequal length between colnames and array width fails
  > duplicate timestamp values fails
  > mangled order of timestamp values fails
  > flipping occurs when needed

  > convert works 
4 facts verified.
ordered collection methods
  > iterator protocol is valid
  > end keyword returns correct index
  > getindex on single Int and Date

  > getindex on range of DateTime when only Date is in timestamp
  > getindex on range of Date
  > getindex on single column name
  > getindex on multiple column name
  > getindex on 1d returns 1d object

time series methods
  > lag takes previous day and timestamps it to next day
  > lag accepts kwarg
  > lag operates on 2d arrays
  > lag returns 1d from 1d time arrays
  > lag returns 2d from 2d time arrays
  > lead takes next day and timestamps it to current day
  > lead accepts kwarg
  > lead operates on 2d arrays
  > lead returns 1d from 1d time arrays
  > lead returns 2d from 2d time arrays
  > correct simple return value
  > correct log return value
