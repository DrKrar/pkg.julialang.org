tests with small matrices...
...done

In all the following tests, the first time includes the JIT compilation; 
for the second execution the compilation is already done and the time
should be faster.

Testing LLL on 1000x1000 real matrix...

   1.668 seconds      (3569 k allocations: 2533 MB, 10.03% gc time)

Testing LLL on 10x10 complex matrix...

Error Rate is 0.0. It should be zero or very small.

Testing now with 200x200 matrix from latticechallenge.org.
All the column norms should be 30.
max col-norm of input is 233.24879420910193
  70.934 milliseconds (192 k allocations: 91361 KB, 22.03% gc time)
max col-norm of lll-reduced basis is 30.0
  14.853 seconds      (67116 k allocations: 5096 MB, 5.12% gc time)
max column norm of seysen-reduced basis is 30.0
