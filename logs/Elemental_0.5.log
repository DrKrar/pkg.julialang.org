You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 79987d3... Fixing bug in Transform2x2 that was breaking parallel BunchKaufman (the bug was noticed by Andreas Noack), transitioned all header-file inclusions within include/ to angle brackets from quotes, avoided several unused variables, fixed a recently introduced conversion bugs in BigInt and BigFloat, and simplified examples/number_theory/Factor
