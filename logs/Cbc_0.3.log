Testing mixintprog with solver CbcSolver
Cgl0004I processed model has 1 rows, 5 columns (5 integer (5 of which binary)) and 5 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0038I Initial state - 1 integers unsatisfied sum - 0.25
Cbc0038I Solution found of -16
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 4 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of -16 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of -16 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective -16, took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)

[model] Performance warnings
WARNING: The addition operator has been used on JuMP expressions a large number of times. This warning is safe to ignore but may indicate that model generation is slower than necessary. For performance reasons, you should not add expressions in a loop. Instead of x += y, use append!(x,y) to modify x in place. If y is a single variable, you may also use push!(x, coef, y) in place of x += coef*y.
