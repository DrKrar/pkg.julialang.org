WARNING: Method definition require(Symbol) in module Base at loading.jl:308 overwritten at /home/vagrant/.julia/v0.5/Requires/src/hook.jl:17.
WARNING: New definition 
    write(GZip.GZipStream, Array{#T<:Any, N<:Any}) at /home/vagrant/.julia/v0.5/GZip/src/GZip.jl:456
is ambiguous with:

To fix, define
