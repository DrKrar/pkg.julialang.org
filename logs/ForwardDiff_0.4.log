INFO: Testing ForwardDiff
WARNING: New definition 
    write(Base.IO, ForwardDiff.Partials) at /home/vagrant/.julia/v0.4/ForwardDiff/src/partials.jl:57
is ambiguous with: 
    write(Base.Base64.Base64EncodePipe, AbstractArray{UInt8, 1}) at base64.jl:89.
To fix, define 
    write(Base.Base64.Base64EncodePipe, ForwardDiff.Partials{N<:Any, UInt8})
before the new definition.
