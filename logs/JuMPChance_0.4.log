WARNING: deprecated syntax "[a=>b, ...]" at /home/vagrant/.julia/v0.4/GLPKMathProgInterface/src/GLPKInterfaceMIP.jl:398.
Use "Dict(a=>b, ...)" instead.
WARNING: The meaning of with_probability has flipped! Constraints should be satisfied with given probability or greater. For backwards compatibility, this constraint will be interpreted in the old sense.
WARNING: beginswith is deprecated, use startswith instead.
