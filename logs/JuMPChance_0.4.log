Operator overloads and printing
WARNING: The meaning of with_probability has flipped! Constraints should be satisfied with given probability or greater. For backwards compatibility, this constraint will be interpreted in the old sense.
87 facts verified.
Printing two-sided constraints
3 facts verified.
Basic chance constraint model
6 facts verified.
Deprecated comparison operator overloads
WARNING: The comparison operator >= has been deprecated for constructing chance constraints. Use the form @addConstraint instead.
